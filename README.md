# FileEncrypter.py
## FileEncrypter.py is a python script for symmetrical encryption/decryption.

The FileEncrypter.py Python script is a basic symmetric encryption and decryption tool. It uses the Pathlib and Cryptography.Fernet modules and absolute paths.  
  
The script prompts the user to select an option (1 for encryption and 2 for decryption) and a path for the file or directory on which the user wants to work. Then, the script generates or searches for a key file and proceeds to encrypt or decrypt the files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **(Make sure you work with absolute paths, and be carefull with your files.)**.
