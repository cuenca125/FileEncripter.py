# FileEncripter.py
## FileEncrypter.py is a python script for symmetrical encryption/decryption.

The FileEncrypter.py python script is a basic symmetrical encryption and decryption tool, it works using the pathlib and cryptography.fernet modules and absolute paths.    
It prompts the user to select an option (1 for Encryption and 2 for Decryption) and a path for the file or directory that the user wants to work on, then it generates a keyfile or searches for one,
and proceeds to Encrypt or Decrypt the files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **(Make sure you work with absolute paths, and be carefull with your files.)**.
